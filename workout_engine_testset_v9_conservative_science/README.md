# Workout Engine Test Set v9 (Conservative + Exercise-Aware)

Designed to be a strict calibration target:
- Conservative progression (lots of holds).
- Exercise-aware (isolation rep-first; compounds gated by RPE cushion).
- Experience-aware (beginner vs intermediate vs advanced).
- Includes cut-mode maintenance bias and practical edge cases.
