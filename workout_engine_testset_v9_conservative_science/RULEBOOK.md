# RULEBOOK — v9 (super conservative, exercise-aware)

Key design choices:
- Conservative load progression: increase load only when prior performance is clearly below the effort cap (RPE cushion).
- Isolation progression differs from compounds: isolation moves (e.g., lateral raise) progress mainly via reps and require multiple clean top-rep hits before load increases.
- Experience scaling:
  - Beginners can increase slightly more often, but still gated by easy sessions.
  - Intermediates increase less often; more holds.
  - Advanced uses microloading and strict "two easy sessions" gating for bench.
- Readiness modulation: low readiness triggers small load reductions (≈5%), not aggressive progression.
- Planned deload: ~10% load reduction + set reduction.
- Break resets: ≥14 days without exposure triggers conservative 10–15% reduction.
- Cut mode: increases are blocked unless readiness is truly high (maintenance bias).
