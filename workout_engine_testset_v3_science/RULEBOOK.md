# Rulebook for v3 'science-rooted' progression labels

This dataset is synthetic. It is not a clinical ground truth. The labels implement evidence-informed coaching heuristics.

1) Load increases when reps exceed target by 1-2 at similar effort.
2) Autoregulation with RPE/RIR: hold at target effort, reduce when grinding or missing.
3) Deloads reduce intensity ~10% and volume ~40% (sets reduced).
4) Low readiness days receive ~5% reductions (not automatic deloads).
5) Break handling: >14 days without a lift triggers ~10% reset.
6) Variations and substitutions apply conservative coefficients.
7) Acceptable bands: acceptable_range_lb is +/-2% (minimum one plate step) for evaluation.
