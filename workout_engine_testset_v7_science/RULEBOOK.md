# RULEBOOK — v7 (science-rooted progression labels)

This dataset encodes a conservative, evidence-aligned progression policy for resistance training prescriptions.

Evidence anchors:
- Load progression: increases are generally small and earned (typical guidance: 2–10% increases when targets are exceeded; smaller for upper-body and trained lifters).
- Repetitions-to-%1RM mapping: NSCA-style training-load tables to keep intensities plausible by rep target.
- Autoregulation: RIR-based RPE usage to avoid reckless increases on grinders and to bias toward holds or small reductions when effort is high.
- Deloads: short periods with meaningful volume reduction and modest intensity reduction to dissipate fatigue and restore performance.

Encoded label policy highlights
1) Beginners / early intermediates (novice LP)
- Stepwise increases: ~5 lb for squat/deadlift, ~2.5 lb for bench/OHP.
- No increase after a grinder or a miss; hold instead.
- Early stall after ~6–10 weeks: deload ~10% and cut sets ~40%, then resume progression.

2) Messy adherence and breaks
- Break reset: 7–10 days => ~5% reduction; 14 days => ~10%; 21 days => ~15%.
- Return sessions can feel harder (higher RPE) even at reduced loads.
- An occasional strong return day is modeled without overriding the need for conservative ramping.

3) Microloading constrained pressing
- With 1.25 lb steps, allow frequent small increases when surplus is clear (low RPE and full completion).
- If gym constraints force a larger rounding jump, prefer HOLD over forcing a too-large increase.

4) Intermediate in a cut/recomp
- Bias toward maintenance: holds common; increases rare and typically early in hypertrophy block.
- "False fatigue": low readiness signals without performance decline should not force deloads.
- Modest regressions during true fatigue weeks are realistic.

5) Variations and substitutions
- Separate state per variation; prevent substitution/variation sessions from contaminating baseline lift history.
- Return to standard after extended variation block uses a small ramp-down (~5%) instead of mapping machine loads directly.
