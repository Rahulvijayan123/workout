# RULEBOOK (v4) - Evidence-informed progression policy

Core evidence-informed heuristics encoded in labels:
- Progression: increase load when a lifter can perform 1-2 reps above target at equal or lower effort, with increases bounded 2-10% depending on lift and training status.
- Autoregulation: RPE/RIR targets drive holds, small increases, small decreases, and fatigue deload triggers.
- Deloads: reduce load ~10% and sets ~40% while preserving movement pattern specificity.
- Low readiness: apply ~5% reduction unless already deload/reset.
- Break reset: >14 days without exposure for an exercise triggers ~10% reset.
- Substitution safety: substitutions update a separate exercise state bucket (e.g., squat->leg_press updates leg_press) and do not contaminate squat 1RM.

Evaluation:
- Main lifts are scored using acceptable_range_lb (±2% minimum one load step).
